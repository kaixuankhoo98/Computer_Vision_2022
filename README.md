# Computer_Vision_2022
These are my submissions for the Computer Vision module courseworks for MSc Computing Science at Imperial College London, 2022. All were completed in a Jupyter Notebook file and written in python. Short descriptions of the coursework are as follows:
  - ### CW1: Moving average filters and gaussian filters (using convolutional layers), edge detection, and combination of the two.
  - ### CW2: Using a large dataset of fish images, designing a neural network for image classification, fine tuning parameters, evaluating performance.

See the README files in the respective folders for more detail.
